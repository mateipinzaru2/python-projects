POP VALUES
.pop() is the opposite of .append(). Pop removes the last element from a list and returns it for use. For example:

vegetables = ["broccoli", "cabbage", "kale", "tomato"];
last_vegetable = vegetables.pop()
# vegetables = ['broccoli', 'cabbage', 'kale']
# last_vegetable = 'tomato'

ASSIGNMENT
Our player is selling the items in their inventory to the shopkeep!

Pop the last element from the inventory list until there is nothing left. Pop the elements into an item variable so that each prints in turn on line 19.
