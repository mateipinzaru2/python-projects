WHAT IS POLYMORPHISM?
While inheritance is the most unique trait that object-oriented languages claim to have, polymorphism is probably the most powerful.

Polymorphism is the ability of a variable, function or object to take on multiple forms. For example, in a programming language that supports inheritance, classes in the same hierarchical tree may have methods with the same name but different behaviors.

SHAPES
Let's look at a simple example.

class Creature():
    def move(self):
        print("the creature moves")

class Dragon(Creature):
    def move(self):
        print("the dragon flies")

class Kraken(Creature):
    def move(self):
        print("the kraken swims")

for creature in [Creature(), Dragon(), Kraken()]:
    creature.move()
# prints:
# the creature moves
# the dragon flies
# the kraken swims

In this example, the child classes, Dragon and Kraken are overriding the behavior of their parent class's move() method.

ASSIGNMENT
First, we'll need a new class that represents a rectangle. Take a look at the test cases in main_test.py to see how it's expected to behave. Variables should be passed into the constructor in this order:

x1
y1
x2
y2
"""


class Rectangle:
    def __init__(self, x1, y1, x2, y2):
        self.x1 = x1
        self.y1 = y1
        self.x2 = x2
        self.y2 = y2
